Notes from installation:
1. Would be good to have a command that builds the database (ie. runs db/schema.sql which I had to run manually, then seeds the database). `npm run start` currently creates the tables but nothing else. 
2. Server file is a bit messy - might be worth making notes. It also doesn't really match the one in the SQL week at all - and imports so many files!
