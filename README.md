<h2 align="center"> Gym Session Tracker. <i> Version 1.0.0 </i> </h2>

<p><strong>Weight a Minute...!</strong> is a full-stack gym tracking application that allows users to track their workouts on-the-go. Our goal was to build a gym application that, unlike a lot of gym applications on the market, doesn't try to push you into a fixed program: but instead lets your record and view your own data in a way that suits you. Our goal was to build a clean user interface with a user experience that is easy to use/navigate at the gym. 

This application was build for the <strong>University of Birmingham Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp</strong>, over two weeks, by a team of four junior developers. It is built in <em>JavaScript</em>/<em>Node</em>, with  <em>Express</em> routing and a <em>RESTful API</em> that carries out a complete set of CRUD queries. It is supported by a <em>MySQL</em> database and <em>Sequelize ORM</em>(Object-Relational Mapping). We used the templating engine <em>Handlebars</em>, and <em>HTML</em>, <em>CSS</em> and <em>responsive design principles</em> for the front-end.   

It was built in two weeks and still needs a little love: but we'd love you to take a look at what we managed to build in that short time!</p>

## Notes on the current repository
This is a group project build for the University of Birmingham Coding Bootcamp - but the version you are looking at is my own fork, that I am aiming to refactor over the coming month. I am making changes based on what I've learned since completing the Bootcamp, and to improve the application that was originally built under time pressure (we had two weeks). You can view the group repository for the project [here](https://github.com/HummaNosh/Weight-A-Minute).  

I am rewriting the README, so it is currently in note form. You can read the old README (also note form but more detailed) [here](./docs/OLD-README.md). You can view my current road map / list of tasks [here](./docs/ROADMAP.md). You can read more detailed notes on my thoughts around the project in its current state [here](./docs/REFACTOR-NOTES.md).

# Live Deployment
This project was deployed on Heroku under the free membership, which is no longer available. I intend to redeploy the project to Amazon Web Service's EC2 soon.

5. Technology Stack
- JavaScript, Node: Languages / runtime environment.  
- Node Package Manager: Bringing in libraries to build with.  
- Express: Routing, both front-end/between HTML pages and back-end/querying the server.  
- MySQL: Database.
- Sequelize: ODM for the database.
- Handlebars: Template engine.
- bcrypt: encryption.
- dotenv: package for environment variables. 
- AWS EC2: Hosting the website.
- AWS S3: Storing user data / profile images.
- Chart.js: Pie chart, currently used for health tips but at some point hopefully will display user data. 

7. Installation
These are the instructions to install and run our application locally. These instructions assume you have Node and the node package manager installed; docker installed; and an SSH key set up with GitHub so you can clone a repository. 

## Installing the Files
1. Clone the repository. Navigate to the directory you want to save the application in. Run the command `git clone git@github.com:djbowen95/Weight-a-Minute.git`. Once installed, navigate to the directory with `cd Weight-a-Minute`.
2. Install the node modules locally. Run `npm install` from the application's route directory.
3. Create a .env file in the route directory. An example would be:
`DB_NAME=weight_a_minute
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_USER=root`
But make the password unique. 

### Setting Up the Database Locally
These instructions are for windows users.
4. Set up docker container for mysql database (duplicate instructions / explain instructions from inst. repo?)
5. Connect to the database from the command line: `winpty mysql -h127.0.0.1 -uroot -ppassword` (maybe changer user / password).
6. Run the schema by entering this command to the mysql CLI: `source config/db/schema.sql`.
7. Exit the mysql command-line interface.
8. Seed the database by running `node seeds/seeds.js` from the route directory.

## Running the Application 
9. Run `npm run start`. 
10. The application should now be running on PORT 3001 or the port you assigned in your .env file (?). You can view it at `http://localhost:3001` or at `http://127.0.0.1:3001/`.
