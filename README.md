This is a group project build for the University of Birmingham Coding Bootcamp. I am making changes based on what I've learned since completing the Bootcamp, and to improve the application that was originally built under time pressure (we had two weeks). You can view the group repository for the project [here](https://github.com/HummaNosh/Weight-A-Minute).  

I am rewriting the README, so it is in note form. You can read the old README (also note form but more detailed) [here](./docs/OLD-README.md).
