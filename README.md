<h2 align="center"> Gym Session Tracker. <i> Version 1.0.0 </i> </h2>

This is a group project build for the University of Birmingham Coding Bootcamp. I am making changes based on what I've learned since completing the Bootcamp, and to improve the application that was originally built under time pressure (we had two weeks). You can view the group repository for the project [here](https://github.com/HummaNosh/Weight-A-Minute).  

I am rewriting the README, so it is in note form. You can read the old README (also note form but more detailed) [here](./docs/OLD-README.md).


TO DO LIST:
ESSENTIAL
1. Fix front-end routes - navigate only to complete pages, change names to sensible names. 
1B. Also plan / replan database architecture and names (?)
2. Fix front-end pages (html / css).
3. Have New Exercise / History write and retrieve data.
4. Check and annotate user stuff.
5. Add the 'workout' properly / logic and organisation for that.
6. Host

NICE TO HAVE
7. Enhance command-line commands / set up
8. Add S3 so users can upload own images
9. Graphs + Charts
10. Tests (for controllers in particular)

NOT CODING
11. Read Me (and other documentation?)

5. Technology Stack
JavaScript, Node: Languages / runtime environment.
Node Package Manager: Bringing in libraries to build with.
Express: Routing, both front-end/between HTML pages and back-end/querying the server.
MySQL: Database.
Sequelize: ODM for the database.
Handlebars: Template engine.
bcrypt: encryption.
dotenv: package for environment variables. 
AWS EC2: Hosting the website.
AWS S3: Storing user data / profile images.
Graphs - not sure yet.

7. Installation
These are the instructions to install and run our application locally. These instructions assume you have Node and the node package manager installed; docker installed; and an SSH key set up with GitHub so you can clone a repository. 
These instructions assume you have node and the node package manager installed. To install and run the application locally:
1. Clone the repository. Navigate to the directory you want to save the application in. Run the command `git clone git@github.com:djbowen95/Weight-a-Minute.git`. Once installed, navigate to the directory with `cd Weight-a-Minute`.
2. Install the node modules locally. Run `npm install` from the application's route directory.
3. Create a .env file in the route directory. An example would be:
`DB_NAME=weight_a_minute
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_USER=root`
But make the password unique. 

These instructions are for windows users.
4. Set up docker container for mysql database (duplicate instructions / explain instructions from inst. repo?)
5. Connect to the database from the command line: `winpty mysql -h127.0.0.1 -uroot -ppassword` (maybe changer user / password).
6. Run the schema by entering this command to the mysql CLI: `source db/schema.sql`.
7. Exit the mysql command-line interface.
8. Seed the database by running `node seeds/seeds.js` from the route directory.
9. Run `npm run start`. 
10. The application should now be running on PORT 3001 or the port you assigned in your .env file (?). You can view it at `http://localhost:3001` or at `http://127.0.0.1:3001/`.
