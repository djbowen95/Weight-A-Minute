<h2 align="center"> Gym Session Tracker. <i> Version 1.0.0 </i> </h2>

<p><strong>Weight a Minute...!</strong> is a full-stack gym tracking application that allows users to track their workouts on-the-go. Our goal was to build a gym application that, unlike a lot of gym applications on the market, doesn't try to push you into a fixed program: but instead lets your record and view your own data in a way that suits you. Our goal was to build a clean user interface with a user experience that is easy to use/navigate at the gym. 

This application was build for the <strong>University of Birmingham Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp</strong>, over two weeks, by a team of four junior developers. It is built in <strong><em>JavaScript</em></strong> / <strong><em>Node</em></strong>, with  <strong><em>Express</em></strong> routing and a <strong><em>RESTful API</em></strong> that carries out a complete set of CRUD queries. It is supported by a <strong><em>MySQL</em></strong> database and <strong><em>Sequelize ORM</em></strong> (Object-Relational Mapping). We used the templating engine <strong><em>Handlebars</em></strong>, and <strong><em>HTML</em></strong>, <strong><em>CSS</em></strong> and <strong><em>responsive design principles</em></strong> for the front-end.   

It was built in two weeks and still needs a little love: but we'd love you to take a look at what we managed to build in that short time!</p>

## Notes on the current repository
This is a group project build for the University of Birmingham Coding Bootcamp - but the version you are looking at is my own fork, that I am aiming to refactor over the coming month. I am making changes based on what I've learned since completing the Bootcamp, and to improve the application that was originally built under time pressure (we had two weeks). You can view the group repository for the project [here](https://github.com/HummaNosh/Weight-A-Minute).  

I am rewriting the README, so it is currently in note form. You can read the old README (also note form but more detailed) [here](./docs/OLD-README.md). You can view my current road map / list of tasks [here](./docs/ROADMAP.md). You can read more detailed notes on my thoughts around the project in its current state [here](./docs/REFACTOR-NOTES.md).

## Live Deployment
This project was deployed on Heroku under the free membership, which is no longer available. I intend to redeploy the project to Amazon Web Service's EC2 soon. 

In the mean time, if you want to view the application, you can follow the installation instructions [here](.docs/INSTALLATION.md).
