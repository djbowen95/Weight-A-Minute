<h2 align="center"> Gym Session Tracker. <i> Version 1.0.0 </i> </h2>
<p><strong>Weight a Minute...!</strong> is a gym tracker that gives users total freedom to record their workout just how they want to. So many gym applications go hard trying to sell a workout program: not us! <strong>Weight a Minute...!</strong> lets your record <em>your own workout, your own way</em>. You name the exercise. You set the number of sets and reps. You choose your weights. We've aimed to give you an easy way to store and view your data. We leave all the choices about your workout program to you!</p>

<p><strong>Weight a Minute...!</strong> is a <em>full-stack application</em> built in <strong><em>JavaScript</em></strong> and <strong><em>Node.js</em></strong>, with an <strong><em>Express</em></strong> server and a <strong><em>MySQL</em></strong> database. It uses <strong><em>Handlebars</em></strong> for templating; <strong><em>Advanced CSS</em></strong> for responsive design; <strong><em>Sequelize</em></strong> for Object-Relational Mapping; and <strong><em>bcrypt</em></strong> for encryption. We built it together as an end of term project on the University of Birmingham and 2U/Trilogy Web Development Coding Bootcamp. It was built in two weeks and still needs a little love: but we'd love you to take a look at what we managed to build in that short time!</p>
